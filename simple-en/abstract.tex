We present Nabulas, a decentralized platform which provides search framework for all blockchains. Nebulas  builds index for fast-growing data on blockchains to make your search easier, and ranks the indexed data to make your search more valuable.

In order to do ranking in a decentralized platform, we introduce Nebulas Rank (NR) into Nebulas as a trustful, computable and deterministic ranking algorithm. Using Nebulas Rank, we can calculate ranking scores for users based on their actions on blockchains. With these scores, we can rank almost everything based on the interactivity between users and other entities on blockchains.

In addition, Nebulas's another primary contribution to the blockchain world is a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Devotion (PoD). As for a consensus algorithm, we think it should achieve three key points: speediness, irreversibility and fairness. However, Proof of Work (PoW) just meets irreversibility and fairness. Proof of Stake (PoS) only satisfies speediness and irreversibility. Proof of Importance (PoI) merely achieves speediness and fairness. PoD is similar to PoS and integrated with PoI to achieve these three goals at the same time.
