We are here to present Nabulas, a decentralized platform which provides a search framework for all blockchains. Nebulas indexes rapid growing data on blockchains to facilitate your search, and ranks the indexed data to let you retrieve high-value information.

In order to do decentralized search and ranking, Nebulas introduces Nebulas Rank (NR) -- a trustful, computable and deterministic ranking algorithm. Using Nebulas Rank, we can calculate scores for users based on their activities on blockchains. With these scores, we can rank almost everything from the interactions between users and other entities on blockchains.

In addition, Nebulas proposes a new consensus algorithm called Proof of Devotion (PoD), to the blockchain world. We think a consensus algorithm can be evaluated by three key points: speediness, irreversibility and fairness. Proof of Work (PoW) only meets irreversibility and fairness. Proof of Stake (PoS) just satisfies speediness and irreversibility. Proof of Importance (PoI) merely achieves speediness and fairness. By taking best parts from PoS and PoI in an innovative way, PoD achieves the three goals at the same time.
