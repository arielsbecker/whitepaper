\section{Nebulas Force}
\label{sec:nebulasforce}

We use Nebulas Force (NF) to describe the evolving capability of the blockchain system and its applications. As the first driving force of the blockchain system and its application development, the Nebulas Force includes three aspects, that is, the Nebulas Virtual Machine (NVM), the upgrade of the protocol code in the blockchain system, and the upgrade of the smart contract running on the blockchain system.

In Nebulas, we will introduce LLVM to implement the Nebulas Virtual Machine (NVM). The protocol code and the smart contract code will be compiled into NVM bytecode, which is dynamically compiled and optimized with the LLVM just-in-time (JIT) compilation function and eventually executed in the sandbox environment. Meanwhile, with the modular architecture of LLVM, developers can use their familiar programming languages to implement safer and higher-performance smart contracts, providing users with various decentralized applications.

For the upgrade of the protocol code in Nebulas, Nebulas will add the protocol code to block structure to carry out the upgrade of the protocol code by supplementing additional data on chains so as to avoid the possible split or bifurcation between developers and communities. With the development of Nebulas communities, the upgrade capability of NF and basic protocols will be gradually open to communities, and communities will define the evolving direction of the Nebulas and achieve its upgrade target. With the help of the core technology and the opening concept of NF, Nebulas will have a continuously evolving space and an infinitely evolving possibility. For example, a series of parameters including the NR algorithm parameter, the PoD incentive amount, the consensus algorithm and the production rate of new tokens can be gradually adjusted during the development of Nebulas without upgrading most client codes.

The smart contract is usually considered to be permanent and does not support upgrading. With the help of the design of underlying storage of the smart contract to support the cross-contract visit of state variables, Nebulas can complete the upgrade of the smart contract. This solution is very friendly to developers, making them respond to bugs more rapidly, which can prevent huge losses to users caused by any hacker events.
