\subsubsection*{What We Hold}

From a highly abstract perspective, blockchain is \textbf{the right confirmation of data in a decentralized way}, and tokens function as \textbf{the carrier of right confirmation value}. The Internet solves the communication of data, while blockchain further solves the right confirmation of data. For the first time ever, blockchain translates public data into private data which will no longer be analyzed and utilized arbitrarily by large enterprises such as Google, Amazon and Facebook.

The essence of blockchain represented by public blockchain is \textbf{``Community + Token + Application"}. Community is essentially a from-bottom-to-top ecosystem adhering to the idea of openness, open source, sharing and non-profitability, which is completely different from existing from-top-to-bottom business ecosystems. Token is the carrier of right confirmation value. There will be more scenarios in the future than those used only for attributes of virtual currency and electronic cash. Application simply refer to the technological implementation of blockchain application scenarios. Without the combination with the aforementioned two factors, application alone \textbf{cannot fully reflect the charm of blockchain systems}.

The blockchain system represented by public blockchain is the future of blockchain, as its \textbf{``trustless"} and \textbf{``permissionless"} attributes are the actual value of blockchain systems. On the contrary, most consortium blockchain/enterprise blockchain are \textbf{``trust-based"} and \textbf{``permission-based"}, which means they cannot break existing patterns and are considered as improved innovations. While public blockchain systems overturn existing cooperation relations and are considered \textbf{disruptive innovations}, reflecting the maximum value of blockchain.

\subsubsection*{What We Are Committed To}

Be as the first blockchain search engine around the world, Nebulas is committed to \textbf{exploring hidden dimensions of blockchain value} and building value-based blockchain operating systems, search engines and other related extensive apps.

With this commitment, we put forward \textbf{Nebulas Rank} to set up the measure of value of the blockchain world, design \textbf{Nebulas Force} to empower the self-evolving of blockchains, develop \textbf{Developer Incentive Protocol} and \textbf{Proof of Devotion} to motivate the upgrade of blockchain value, and construct \textbf{Nebulas Search Engine} to help users explore other dimensions of blockchain value.

\subsubsection*{What We Believe}

The ongoing scientific and technological evolving will lead us to a better life with a higher level of \textbf{freedom and equality}. As one of the major technologies, blockchain will gradually give full play to its advantages. Being part of this evolving is our greatest happiness and accomplishment.

Similar to the Internet, blockchains will also enter a phase of explosive users/apps. Blockchain technology will become the \textbf{base protocol} of the next-generation ``smart network", and the number of users will reach or even go beyond one billion in the next 5 to 10 years. Significant opportunities and challenges will both emerge in the next five years.

Facing the tremendous ecosystem in the future, ask not what blockchain can do for you, ask what you can do for blockchain. Because \textbf{blockchain is an organism and economy}. We are glad to share these with all of you in the exploration of blockchain technologies.
